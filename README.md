## Icon conversion

The original icons can be found in the directory [`original_icons`](./original_icons).

To convert the original `.ani` icons in this directory to `.png` the program [`pinta`](https://www.pinta-project.com/) was used.

To convert the `.png` icons to the `.xcf` (x11 cursor format) the program [`gimp`](https://www.gimp.org/) was used.
